# QTRB
The name **QTRB** means "Qt Raspbian", it's a preconfigured **Raspbian OS** with a recent **Qt**.

This project is inspired by [QtRpi](https://github.com/neuronalmotion/qtrpi) but targets different achivements:
 * providing a **ready-to-use package** (QTRB system image, developper tools, ...)
 * support only one recent version of **Qt** (5.9.1)
 * support only one recent version of **Raspbian** (Stretch: 2017-09)
 * support a lot of **Qt modules**
